Rules:
XML Documents cannot reference themselves
XML imports a maximum of 10 levels deep
Default mode of operation is serial for plays unless specified as parallel

Modules
Functions must support the EXACT same parameter names
XML validation only ensure parameters are in the defined list, does not handle if they are not present
Modules and their functions must singular form
They must have a ztask and ztaskparameters
Modules are responsible for error handling

XML
Play order overrides document order
The server task name is reserved and cannot be implement by module

zEngine
Informational messages are used instead of write-host for output.  To see output you must set 
InformationAction or InformationVariables.  Setting InformationAction will prevent the log file from capturing
messages.

Ex1.  No output to the screen except warnings and errors.  All output goes to the transcript and windows event log
zEngine.ps1 -path .\playbooks\RobotStart.xml

Ex2.  All output to the screen including information, warnings, and errors.  Only errors and warnings go to the transcript and windows event log
zEngine.ps1 -path .\playbooks\RobotStart.xml -informationaction continue

Ex3.  All output to the screen, transcript, and eventlog including information, warnings, and errors.
zEngine.ps1 -path .\playbooks\RobotStart.xml 6>&1

The temporary file used for transcript logging create a tmp file in the user profile.  This may need to move.
